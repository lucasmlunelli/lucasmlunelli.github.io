NBA is one of the largest sports leagues in the world and every year it moves billions of dollars in
sponsorship and betting. In addition to the money involved, many metrics about players and teams
are generated, which is a great opportunity for data enthusiasts. Thus, this project will use this data
to develop machine learning models to predict the results of NBA games and, from the model's
results, build a simple betting system.

The experimental part consists of five steps. The first one is mastering the subject. Next, is the data
collection and its exploratory analysis. After that, the data is preprocessed and new features are
created. The next step is the modeling. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms such
as decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks and ensembles. After first evaluation, the more
important features are selected and incorporated into the model, always aiming to increase its
accuracy. Using modelÂ´s results is possible now to create betting strategies. Finally, the results of the
model and betting strategies are evaluated through several metrics and comparisons with the results
found in the literature
